# -Carbon-Android-I automated the Carbon Android application using Katalon Studio.

To run this, you need to install the following on your laptop:

After installing Vysor on your latop, you will go to the settings of your Android device to activate it.

Followed by Developer options to enable USB debugging.

In conclusion, you open Katalon Studio and select Carbon Android project and select which of the following test cases you want to execute :

However, the test cases that passed are the following:
